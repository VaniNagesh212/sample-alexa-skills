# sample-praise me-alexa-skills
this skill praises a person when he enters his name

Initial-set up:
Initially we need to set up a front end part of this skill by logging in into amazon alexa developer console account.
Where we get pre-built alexa skill kit and create the intents that are used in this code and than type the sample utterences for each intent.
connect this front end with the backend by uploading this code into the aws lambda function(connection is eastablished by providing the front end endpoint to backend and similarly backend endpoint to front end).
